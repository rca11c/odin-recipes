This is my first HTML/GIT project for the Odin course.

I intend to make a recipe list website, to practice my HTML base skills such as:
1. text management (headers, paragraphs, bold, italisized)
2. images and linking to other pages
3. ordered and unordered list
4. maintaining development of this with useful git pushes
