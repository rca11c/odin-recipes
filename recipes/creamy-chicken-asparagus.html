        <h1>Creamy Chicken Asparagus</h1>

        <h2>Description</h1>
            <p>This recipe will make 4 servings of pork fried rice, and I encourage following the instructions exactly.
                If you must, you dont need the lemon juice, but it does add just a little bit of flavor to really
                bring the recipe together for you. This is one of my favorites, I make it a few times a month as it's 
                easy, cheap, and fast.</p>
            <p>When reheating this recipe, I suggest covering the bowl you choose with a wet paper towel in order
                to help the rice become fluffy again instead of stiff.</p>
