            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe will make 10 beef enchiladas in almost no time with very little effort. It's beef and cheese
                in a corn tortialla, what more could you want? The toppings of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, etc. are all
                optional.</p>
            <p>I personally enjoy these with no toppings, simple is still delicious.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 Lb Ground Beef</li>
                    <li>1 small white onion <em>diced</em></li>
                    <li>1 garlic clove <em>minced</em></li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                    <li>10 corn tortillas</li>
                    <li>28 oz red enchilada sauce</li>
                    <li>3 cups freshly shredded cheese</li>
                    <li><em>optional: sour cream, pico de gallo or salsa, diced avocado, fresh cilantro</em></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with a tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Add the diced onions and cook, stirring frequently until they begin to soften.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef and minced garlic. Cook beef, breaking up with a spoon, 
                        until no longer pink; 5-7 minutes. Drain excess grease or soak up with paper towels.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle taco seasoning and cumin over the beef and stir in ¼ cup of water. Continue
                         to cook, stirring often, until water is absorbed.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350℉. Pour ½ a cup of enchilada sauce in the bottom of a 13×9-inch 
                        baking dish and spread evenly.</li>
                    <li>Heat remaining sauce in a small-medium size skillet, just until it begins to bubble, 
                        then remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Wrap a stack of 10 corn tortillas in a clean kitchen towel and microwave on high for
                         30 seconds to a minute. Dip a tortilla in the enchilada sauce to coat both sides 
                         then lay flat on a cutting board or plate. Add a small amount of the meat mixture 
                         (about 3 tablespoons) down the center of the tortilla, then top with about 1-2 
                         tablespoons of shredded cheese. Roll up both sides and place seam-side down in the 
                         prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and meat.</li>
                    <li>Pour remaining sauce evenly over the enchiladas and top with remaining shredded cheese.</li>
                    <li>Bake uncovered for about 25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Let sit 5-10 minutes before serving. Garnish as desired with optional toppings like sour 
                        cream, pico de gallo, avocado, sliced green onions or cilantro.</li>
                </ol>
