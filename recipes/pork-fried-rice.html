        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe will make 4 servings of delicious pork fried rice. Many of the ingredients
                can be optional, such as the peas and green onion, but the whole mixture is really a good combination.
                I recommend giving it a try, but removing those ingredient can make it both cheaper and easier to make,
                and really doesnt detract too much from the flavor.</p>
